# Express OAuth 2 handlers

This library provides pre-built boilerplate code for obtaining and storing OAuth 2.0 tokens on Google Cloud Platform.
It forks `@google-cloud/express-oauth2-handlers` and change it to use `firestore` instead of `datastore`

## Configuration
In order to use the library, several variables must be set. These values can be stored as Linux environment variables.

If a web application client secret file named `client_secret.json` is present in the root directory of your function/app, the required values below will be automatically imported.

##### Required values
The following values can be obtained by [generating a new OAuth 2.0 client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) or reusing an existing one:
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL`

**Note**
These values (and in particular the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` value) should not be stored/committed alongside your codebase except when deployed to GCP hosting platforms. As such, this library does _not_ support specifying these values programmatically.

##### Reserved values

##### `FUNCTION_TRIGGER_TYPE`
This value is set by [some](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/env-var#reserved_keys_key_validation) (but not all) Google Cloud hosting platforms. Do **not** set it yourself or change its value.

##### `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
This value should be set to your GCP project ID automatically. If it isn't, make sure you do this manually.

##### Optional settings values
The following values can be specified during either the configuration or [initialization](#initialization) processes. Where values are different between the two, those specified during initialization take precedence.

###### `TOKEN_STORAGE_METHOD`
Specify how OAuth 2.0 tokens will be stored. *Must* be one of the following values:
- `cookie` Stores tokens on a _per-user basis_ using browser cookies.
- `firestore` Stores tokens _globally_ using [Cloud Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore).

We recommend using `cookie` unless you have code running in a non-HTTP environment, as this delegates authentication to the user's browser.

The `firestore` option is best when part or all of your code isn't triggered by HTTP. **However, you must manually verify the authenticity of all `firestore` requests yourself.**

###### `DEFAULT_SCOPES`
A comma-separated list (such as `scope1,scope2,scope3`) of OAuth 2.0 scopes to use. See [this page](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes) for a list of OAuth 2.0 scopes supported by Google APIs.

###### `USER_ID_FORMAT`
The format to use for unique User IDs. Two formats are supported:
- `email` email addresses
- `gaiaId` Google accounts ID numbers

We recommend using `gaiaId` when possible. However, some external platforms require the use of email addresses as unique User IDs. 

###### `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
Specifies the encryption method and/or key to use when encrypting OAuth 2.0 tokens as follows, from _least secure_ to _most secure_:
- `undefined` or not specified: use the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` value of your OAuth 2.0 configuration as a `tweetnacl` symmetric encryption key
- any other string: use this value as a `tweetnacl` symmetric encryption key. **This string should be generated using [cryptography-safe](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/39188) randomness tools and kept secret.**
- `KMS` (case insensitive): use [Cloud KMS][kms]

When using `tweetnacl`, the `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` value is hashed using `sha256` and truncated to generate the key used in the application.

###### `KMS_KEY_RING` and `KMS_KEY_NAME`
These values are used to encrypt stored OAuth 2.0 tokens when using [Cloud KMS][kms] (i.e. when [`TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`](#token_encryption_key) is set to `KMS`), and can be obtained by [creating a Cloud KMS encryption key](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/quickstart#key_rings_and_keys).

## Initialization
When importing and initializing the library, several different parameters are used.

###### `storageMethod`
_Optional._ Specify how OAuth 2.0 tokens will be stored. Identical to (and takes precedence over) [`TOKEN_STORAGE_METHOD`](#token_storage_method) above.

###### `scopes`
_Optional._ An array of OAuth 2.0 scopes to request. See [this page](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes) for a list of OAuth 2.0 scopes supported by Google APIs. Takes precedence over the `DEFAULT_SCOPES` environment variable.

###### `userIdFormat`
_Optional._ The format to use for unique User IDs. Identical to (and takes precedence over) [`USER_ID_FORMAT`](#user_id_format) above.

###### `showInternals`
_Optional._ If set to `true`, certain internal methods will be exposed.

##### Example
```javascript
const Auth = require('@google-cloud/express-oauth2-handlers');

// Cookie
const auth = Auth('cookie', ['profile', 'email']);

// Firestore
const auth = Auth('firestore', ['profile', 'email'], 'email');
```

##### Storage Methods
Use the following chart to decide which storage method is right for your use case.

|                                  | `cookie` | `firestore` |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| Requires user IDs?               | **No**   | Yes |
| Requires end-user interaction? ^ | Yes      | **No** |
| Works with free tier? +          | **Yes**  | No |
| Platform restricted?             | **No**   | Google Cloud only |

_^ When fetching existing tokens_

_+ [Cloud KMS][kms] can be used for [token encryption](#token_encryption_key), and does **not** have a free tier._

## Routes
Routes are functions that emulate [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect)-style middleware. They are compatible with [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express), as well as Express-like platforms such as [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/calling/http).

##### Arguments
`scope_array`
_Optional._ An array of OAuth2 scopes to request

#### `routes.cb`
`cb` is a route that serves as an OAuth 2.0 callback URL. It consumes a one-time _authorization code_, converts it into a reusable _access token_, and stores the access token using the specified storage method.

##### Arguments
`onSuccess`
_Optional._ A URL to redirect to **or** a callback function that accepts Express-like `req` and `res` parameters to be called once the `cb` route successfully obtains and stores an access token. 

`onFailure`
_Optional._ A URL to redirect to **or** a callback function that accepts Express-like `req` and `res` parameters to be called if the `cb` route fails to obtain and store an access token.

_Note: if one of `onSuccess` and `onFailure` is provided, the other must be provided as well._

## Invocation

##### App Engine

```javascript
// Express middleware format - no arguments
app.get('/oauth2init', oauth2.routes.init);
app.get('/oauth2callback', oauth2.routes.cb);

// Express middleware format - all arguments
app.get('/oauth2init', oauth2.routes.init(['scope_1', 'scope_2'])); // Array of OAuth scopes to request
app.get('/oauth2callback', oauth2.routes.cb('/success', '/failure')); // "onSuccess" and "onFailure" as redirect URLs

// Express middleware format - "onSuccess" and "onFailure" as callbacks
// - Technically possible, but not documented because it's bad practice
// - Instead, use additional Express middleware functions
```

##### Cloud Functions
```javascript
// HTTP Cloud Function format - no arguments
exports.oauth2init = oauth2.routes.init;
exports.oauth2callback = oauth2.routes.cb;

// HTTP Cloud Function format - all arguments
exports.oauth2init = oauth2.routes.init(['scope_1', 'scope_2']);
exports.oauth2callback = oauth2.routes.cb('/oauth2success', '/oauth2failure');

// HTTP Cloud Function format - "onSuccess" and "onFailure" as callbacks
// - Cloud Functions doesn't support Express-style middleware
// - Instead, you can use callbacks to handle post-route logic
const onSuccess = (req, res) => { ... }
const onFailure = (err, req, res) => { ... }

exports.oauth2init = ... // same as above
exports.oauth2callback = oauth2.routes.cb(onSuccess, onFailure);
```
